# Getting Started with GitLab Package and Container Registry

This tutorial provides a hands-on guide to familiarize yourself with the GitLab Package Registry and Container Registry. It will walk you through creating simple projects, using GitLab's CI/CD pipelines to interact with registries, and understanding the core concepts through practical examples.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitLab account.
2. A project repository in GitLab.
3. Docker installed on your machine.
4. Basic familiarity with GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

## Step 1: Setting Up a Simple Container Registry Project

### Goal
Store and pull a Docker container image using GitLab's Container Registry.

### Steps

1. **Enable Container Registry for the Project:**
   - Navigate to your GitLab project.
   - Go to `Settings > General > Visibility, project features, permissions`.
   - Expand `Features` and ensure `Container Registry` is enabled. If the registry is not enabled, ensure your administrator has configured the Container Registry as per the [GitLab Container Registry Administration Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html)【86†source】.

2. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   - Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your repository with the following content:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM alpine:latest
     CMD ["echo", "Hello, GitLab Container Registry!"]
     ```

3. **Define CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to the root of your repository with the following content:
     ```yaml
     image: docker:latest

     variables:
       DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2

     services:
       - docker:dind

     stages:
       - build

     build_image:
       stage: build
       script:
         - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" "$CI_REGISTRY"
         - docker build -t "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest" .
         - docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest"
     ```

4. **Push Changes to GitLab:**
   - Commit the changes and push them to your GitLab repository.

5. **View the Container Image:**
   - After the pipeline runs successfully, navigate to `Deploy > Container Registry` in your GitLab project to view the uploaded container image.

6. **Pull the Image Locally:**
   - Authenticate with the GitLab Container Registry:
     ```bash
     docker login registry.gitlab.com
     ```
   - Pull the image:
     ```bash
     docker pull registry.gitlab.com/<namespace>/<project>:latest
     ```

## Step 2: Setting Up a Simple Package Registry Project

### Goal
Publish and consume a custom Python package using GitLab's Package Registry.

### Steps

1. **Create a Python Package:**
   - Create the following files in your project:
     ```plaintext
     my_package/
     ├── __init__.py
     └── my_module.py
     setup.py
     ```
   - `setup.py` content:
     ```python
     from setuptools import setup

     setup(
         name='my_package',
         version='0.1.0',
         packages=['my_package'],
         install_requires=[],
     )
     ```

2. **Define CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the following content:
     ```yaml
     image: python:3.9

     stages:
       - publish

     publish_package:
       stage: publish
       script:
         - pip install twine
         - python setup.py sdist
         - twine upload --repository-url "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/packages/pypi" -u gitlab-ci-token -p "$CI_JOB_TOKEN" dist/*
     ```

3. **Push Changes to GitLab:**
   - Commit and push the changes to trigger the pipeline.

4. **Install the Package Locally:**
   - Authenticate with the GitLab Package Registry:
     ```bash
     pip install --index-url https://__token__:<personal_access_token>@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/pypi/simple my_package
     ```

## Step 3: Cleanup and Maintenance

### Container Registry
- Use the GitLab UI or API to delete unused container images.

### Package Registry
- Set up cleanup policies to automatically remove old or unused packages from the registry.

## Next Steps

- Experiment with additional package types (e.g., Maven, npm).
- Use GitLab CI/CD templates for more complex workflows.
- Explore Dependency Proxy to cache frequently used Docker images.
